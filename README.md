## Introduction

Crag is a personal programming project developed with the aim of exploring and demonstrating a number of programming techniques.

It is written mostly in C++ and is designed to be as portable as possible, using free libraries and tools including:

- [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org/) & [SDL_image](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
- [ODE](http://www.ode.org/)
- [OpenGL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/) | [OpenGL ES](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/)
