# Building Crag for NaCL

## Introduction

This file details how to build and run [Crag](https://code.google.com/p/crag/) on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) GNU Linux systems.
It is tested against [Ubuntu 14.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/trusty/) but should be straight-forward to get working on recent [Debian Jessie](https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/) desktop releases.

NaCL is work in progress and currently crashes consistently.

## Setup and Install

1. Run NaCL setup script

   ```
   cd crag
   nacl/setup.sh
   ```

2. Run:

   `./run.sh`
